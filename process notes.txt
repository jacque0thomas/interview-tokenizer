So, the first thing I considered for this exercise is the bird's eye view 
of implementing.

I started abstracting it in my head, then I took a moment.

How about I start in on the command line interface, then create my stubs?

As I started re-acquinting myself with the Python CLI, I remembered that this 
project will definitely be including libraries, so I took a moment to see if 
there were any tokenizing libriaries that would be of help.

From that, I refreshed myself with nltk and tokenizers. nltk would certainly 
have a tokenizer for creating an array, which would be nice. tokenizers could
be useful, but honestly? I could get enough out of just reading the file.

So, I decided to just dive right in and create some of this from scratch. 
It seems to make the most sense, because I wasn't finding anything that would 
be a good enough shortcut to justify forcing someone to install a new library.
